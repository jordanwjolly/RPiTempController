This is a basic bang-bang temperature controller
It can be used to both heat, and cool an environment based off a desired temperature profile curve.

The system uses the following sensors/actuators:

	- Waterproof DS18B20 Digital temperature sensor for environmental sensing
	- Heating element
	- Cooling element

The various scripts are all launched by runnning launch.sh

A user can toggle a gui graph of temperature histroy turning on/off
The desired curve can be edited by changing the equation in temperature_profile.py
